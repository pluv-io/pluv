# Creating Rooms

Rooms are the channels that WebSockets can enter and leave (i.e. connect and disconnect). Events emitted by sockets in a room will be broadcasted only to other sockets within the same room.

## Creating a PluvRoom

To create a `PluvRoom`, you must first have a `PluvClient` defined. Refer to the [create client](/docs/client/create-client) documentation to do so.

```ts
// frontend/room.ts

import { createClient } from "@pluv/client";
import { yjs } from "@pluv/crdt-yjs";
import { z } from "zod";
import type { ioServer } from "./server/pluv-io";

export const client = createClient({
    infer: (i) => ({ io: i<typeof ioServer> }),
    /**
     * Define the initial storage for rooms that are created.
     * This can be overwritten in `createRoom`
     */
    initialStorage: yjs.doc(() => ({
        messages: yjs.array<string>([]),
    })),
    // Define your presence schema
    presence: z.object({
        selectionId: z.string().nullable(),
    }),
    // ...
});

const room = client.createRoom("my-test-room", {
    // Define the user's initial presence value
    initialPresence: {
        selectionId: null,
    },
    // Overwritten from client
    initialStorage: yjs.doc(() => ({
        messages: yjs.array(["hello world!"]),
    })),
});
```

## Connect to your PluvRoom

```ts
import { client } from "./io";

// connect by room name
await client.enter(ROOM_NAME);

// or connect by room instance
await client.enter(room);
```

## Leave your PluvRoom

```ts
import { client } from "./io";

// leave by room name
client.leave(ROOM_NAME);

// or leave by room instance
client.leave(room);
```
