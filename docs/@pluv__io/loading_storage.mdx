# Loading Storage

Listen to when a room is deleted so that when the same room is re-created, users can resume from the same storage as where they left off.

## Add listeners

Every time a room is freshly created, the `getInitialStorage` listener will run, and the return value of this function will set the initial value of the room's storage.

Beyond this, the `IOServer` provides several event listeners in which you can hook into and save the room's current storage state. It is recommended that you do not save your room's storage state in a handler that runs too frequently so that your database isn't overly written to.

Our recommendation is to save your room's storage state in `onRoomDeleted`. And if you need more saves beyond that, to throttle writes per room in event listeners such as `onStorageUpdated` or `onRoomMessage`.

```ts
// server/io.ts
import { yjs } from "@pluv/crdt-yjs";
import { createIO } from "@pluv/io";
import { platformNode } from "@pluv/platform-node";
import { db } from "./db";

export const io = createIO(
    platformNode({
        // Specify which CRDT to use here
        crdt: yjs,
    })
);

export const ioServer = io.server({
    // Optional: Triggered when a room is freshly created. If the room existed
    // before, you can load the storage state for the room by returning it here
    getInitialStorage: async ({ context, room }) => {
        const { db } = context;
        const existingRoom = await db.room.findUnique({ where: { room } });

        return existingRoom?.encodedState ?? null;
    },
    // Optional: Triggered when a room is deleted. Callback includes the last
    // value for the room's state for persisting purposes
    onRoomDeleted: async ({ context, encodedState, room }) => {
        const { db } = context;

        await db.room.upsert({
            where: { room },
            create: { encodedState, room },
            update: { encodedState },
        });
    },
    // Optional: Triggered each time any participant sends a new message to
    // other participants
    // It is advised not to perform any heavy operations in this listener
    // due to the frequency of invocations
    onRoomMessage: async ({ context, encodedState, room }) => {
        // ...
    },
    // Optional: Triggered each time the room's storage is updated.
    // It is advised not to perform any heavy operations in this listener
    // due to the frequency of invocations
    onStorageUpdated: ({ context, encodedState, room }) => {
        // ...
    },
    // Optional: Triggered each time a user connects to a room
    onUserConnected: ({ context, encodedState, room, user }) => {
        // ...
    },
    // Optional: Triggered each time a user disconnects from a room
    onUserDisconnected: ({ context, encodedState, room, user }) => {
        // ...
    },
});
```
