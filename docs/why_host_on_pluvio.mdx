# Why Host on pluv.io

While [@pluv/io](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pluv/io) is designed for self-hosting first on both [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Cloudflare Worker](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) runtimes, [pluv.io](/) also offers a managed, hosted service via the [@pluv/platform-pluv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pluv/io) library.

## Why choose the pluv.io network

Oddly enough, we actually recommend self-hosting pluv.io yourselves over using the pluv.io network, as it has been designed to be self-hosted easily. Still, below are some reasons why you may want to choose the pluv.io network instead:

### Fully-hosted solution

As pluv.io is a fully-hosted, managed solution, you no longer have to manage nor monitor your own WebSocket servers so you can focus on building for your users.

### Scale and performance

Built on top of [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) via the [@pluv/platform-cloudflare](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pluv/platform-cloudflare) package, your project can create as many rooms as needed on a globally distributed edge network.

### Usage monitoring

Gain insights on how your users use your app by [creating custom events](/docs/react/custom-events) and monitoring how often each get called.

### No vendor lock-in

Switch to self-hosting pluv.io anytime. `@pluv/platform-pluv` does not introduce any platform-specific APIs, allowing you to migrate off the pluv.io network with minimal code changes.

### Support ongoing development

pluv.io is open-source and non VC-funded. Help support ongoing development by letting pluv.io host your realtime servers on your behalf.

## Why not the pluv.io network

Below are reasons why pluv.io should be self-hosted. If these aren't needs for you right away, you can always choose to use the fully-hosted service and migrate off at a later time.

### Typesafe server events

Due to limitations of Cloudflare Worker [Durable Objects](https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/products/durable-objects/), typesafe server events are not supported when using `@pluv/platform-pluv`. This feature requires control of the deployed server, which means pluv.io must be self-hosted to use these.

### Per-message server event listener

When using `@pluv/platform-pluv`, server event listeners work via webhooks. In order not to flood your server with too many requests, `onRoomMessage` is only supported when `@pluv/io` is self-hosted.

### Simple self-hosting

Take control of your own WebSocket server to achieve even more customizability at a lower cost. Hosting `@pluv/io` is incredibly simple, as it was designed for self-hosting first with instructions for [Node.js](/docs/platform-node/hosting-on-nodejs) and [Cloudflare](/docs/platform-cloudflare/hosting-on-cloudflare).
