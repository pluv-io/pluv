# Loading Storage

Listen to when a room is deleted so that when the same room is re-created, users can resume from the same storage as where they left off.

## getInitialStorage

Every time a room is freshly created, the `getInitialStorage` listener will run, and the return value of this function will set the initial value of the room's storage. If this function returns `null`, it is assumed that no storage was found, and a blank storage will be initialized.

```ts
// server/io.ts
import { yjs } from "@pluv/crdt-yjs";
import { createIO } from "@pluv/io";
import { platformNode } from "@pluv/platform-node";
import { db } from "./db";

export const io = createIO(
  platformNode({
    // Specify which CRDT to use here
    crdt: yjs,
  }),
  context: () => ({ db }),
);

export const ioServer = io.server({
  // Optional: Triggered when a room is freshly created. If the room existed
  // before, you can load the storage state for the room by returning it here
  getInitialStorage: async ({ context, room }) => {
    const { db } = context;
    const existingRoom = await db.room.findUnique({ where: { room } });

    return existingRoom?.encodedState ?? null;
  },
});
```

### Using @pluv/platform-pluv

If you are using `@pluv/platform-pluv`, listeners are webhooks under-the-hood. So first, follow [these instructions](/docs/quickstart/nextjs#Project-Webhooks) to setup webhooks for your instance. Then click the storage button from the project webhooks page to enable loading your rooms' initial storage from the selected webhook.

## Add listeners

Beyond this, the `PluvServer` provides several event listeners in which you can hook into and save the room's current storage state. It is recommended that you do not save your room's storage state in a handler that runs too frequently so that your database isn't overly written to.

Our recommendation is to save your room's storage state in `onRoomDeleted`. And if you need more saves beyond that, to throttle writes per room in event listeners such as `onStorageUpdated` or `onRoomMessage`.

> **Note**: Not all event listeners are available when using `@pluv/platform-pluv`. To learn more, please checkout the [quickstart guide](/docs/quickstart/nextjs).

```ts
// ...
export const ioServer = io.server({
  // ...
  // Optional: Triggered when a room is deleted. Callback includes the last
  // value for the room's state for persisting purposes
  onRoomDeleted: async ({ context, encodedState, room }) => {
    const { db } = context;

    await db.room.upsert({
      where: { room },
      create: { encodedState, room },
      update: { encodedState },
    });
  },
  // Optional: Triggered each time any participant sends a new message to
  // other participants
  // It is advised not to perform any heavy operations in this listener
  // due to the frequency of invocations
  onRoomMessage: async ({ context, encodedState, room }) => {
    // ...
  },
  // Optional: Triggered each time the room's storage is updated.
  // It is advised not to perform any heavy operations in this listener
  // due to the frequency of invocations
  onStorageUpdated: ({ context, encodedState, room }) => {
    // ...
  },
  // Optional: Triggered each time a user connects to a room
  onUserConnected: ({ context, encodedState, room, user }) => {
    // ...
  },
  // Optional: Triggered each time a user disconnects from a room
  onUserDisconnected: ({ context, encodedState, room, user }) => {
    // ...
  },
});
```
