# v2 Breaking Changes

There are no breaking changes when upgrading from v1 to v2. Unfortunately, there is an old bug with changesets that causes major releases on minor and patch changes: [GitHub issue here](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/issues/1011).

Going forward, pluv.io will attempt to do better in catching when changesets is attempting an unintended major release.
