# History

`@pluv/react` comes with hooks to manipulate history that are built on top of the CRDT library you are using.

* For Yjs (`@pluv/crdt-yjs`), it is built on top of the [Yjs UndoManager](https://docs.yjs.dev/api/undo-manager).
* For Loro (`@pluv/crdt-loro`), it is built on top of the [Loro UndoManager](https://loro.dev/docs/advanced/undo).

This will allow users to apply undos and redos to Pluv storage mutations.

## Relevant Hooks

* [useCanRedo](/docs/api-reference/react#useCanRedo)
* [useCanUndo](/docs/api-reference/react#useCanUndo)
* [useRedo](/docs/api-reference/react#useRedo)
* [useStorage](/docs/api-reference/react#useStorage)
* [useUndo](/docs/api-reference/react#useUndo)

## Undoing a storage mutation

Assume you have storage defined like so:

```ts
import { yjs } from "@pluv/crdt-yjs";
import { createBundle, createClient } from "@pluv/react";

const client = createClient({
  initialStorage: yjs.doc((t) => ({
    messages: t.array<string>("messages", []),
  })),
  // ...
});

export const {
  useCanRedo,
  useCanUndo,
  useUndo,
  useStorage,
  useRedo,
} = createBundle(client);
```

To get started with modifying your storage history, first make storage mutations.

```ts
const [messages, yArray] = useStorage();

yArray?.push(["hello"]);
yArray?.push(["world"]);
```

Then from anywhere within the `PluvRoomProvider`, you can undo your transacted operations.

```ts
const canUndo: boolean =  useCanUndo();
const canRedo: boolean = useCanRedo();

const undo = useUndo();
const redo = useRedo();

undo();
redo();
```
