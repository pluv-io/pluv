# @pluv/client Rooms

Rooms are the channels that WebSockets can enter and leave (i.e. connect and disconnect). Events emitted by sockets in a room will be broadcasted only to other sockets within the same room.

## Creating a PluvRoom

To create a `PluvRoom`, you must first have a `PluvClient` defined. Refer to the [create client](/docs/create-client) documentation to do so.

```ts
// frontend/room.ts

import { createClient, infer } from "@pluv/client";
import { yjs } from "@pluv/crdt-yjs";
import { z } from "zod";

// Use a type import to avoid including the code in your frontend
import type { ioServer } from "./server/pluv-io";

// Connect your `ioServer` type to the client via `infer`
// Note this is declared outside of `createClient` to workaround
// TypeScript inferrence limitations
const types = infer((i) => ({ io: i<typeof ioServer> }));
export const client = createClient({
  types,
  // Optional: Define the initial storage for rooms. This will
  initialStorage: yjs.doc((t) => ({
    messages: t.array<string>("messages", []),
  })),
  // Optional: Define your presence schema
  presence: z.object({
    selectionId: z.string().nullable(),
  }),
  // Other fields here ...
});

const room = client.createRoom("my-test-room", {
  // Required (if presence is defined on the client): Define
  // the user's initial presence value
  initialPresence: {
    selectionId: null,
  },
  // Optional: Overwrite initial storage from client
  initialStorage: yjs.doc((t) => ({
    messages: t.array("messages", ["hello world!"]),
  })),
  // Optional: Handler when a user fails authorization
  // This only matters if `authorize` has been configured on
  // your `createIO` instance
  onAuthorizationFail: (error: Error) => {
    console.error(error);
  },
  // Optional: Whenever a connection drops, how much time before
  // attempting to reconnect. `attempts` is the count of already
  // failed reconnect attempts, starting from zero.
  // Default: 30_000
  reconnectTimeoutMs: ({ attempts }) => attempts * 1_000,
});
```

## Connect to your PluvRoom

```ts
import { client } from "./io";

const ROOM_NAME = "example-room";

// connect by room name
await client.enter(ROOM_NAME);
// or connect by room instance
await client.enter(room);

// If your `PluvClient` specifies `metadata`, you will need to provide it as
// the 2nd argument when entering
await client.enter(ROOM_NAME, { metadata });
await client.enter(room, { metadata });
```

## Leave your PluvRoom

```ts
import { client } from "./io";

const ROOM_NAME = "example-room";

// leave by room name
client.leave(ROOM_NAME);
// or leave by room instance
client.leave(room);
```
