# Next.js

Learn how to setup pluv.io on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

Next.js is a full-stack [React](https://react.dev/) framework that many host on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). As of this date (March 24, 2025), [Vercel doesn't currently support WebSockets](https://vercel.com/guides/do-vercel-serverless-functions-support-websocket-connections) (i.e. wss protocol) on its platform. As a result, in order to use `@pluv/io` on Next.js, the WebSocket server must be hosted on a separate platform from Vercel, either by self-hosting or by using a managed service (like pluv.io). Check out the docs below for more information on your preferred way to connect to pluv.io.

## Self-hosted

* [Hosting on Cloudflare Workers](/docs/platform-cloudflare/hosting-on-cloudflare)
* [Hosting on Node.js](/docs/platform-node/hosting-on-nodejs)

## Fully-managed

* [Running on pluv.io](/docs/platform-pluv/getting-started)
