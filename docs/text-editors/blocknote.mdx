# BlockNote

> **Note**: pluv.io integrates with BlockNote only via Yjs (i.e. @pluv/crdt-yjs)

> **Note**: This documentation assumes that a basic pluv.io installation has already been completed. Please follow the [quickstart](/docs/quickstart/nextjs) to see how.

[BlockNote](https://www.blocknotejs.org/) is a rich text editor focused on providing a great out-of-the-box experience with minimal setup. It also has been designed to support realtime collaboration with [Yjs](https://yjs.dev) via a `collaboration` config on the editor's initialization. Because pluv.io's storage API is built around Yjs, we can simply connect a BlockNote editor to a `PluvRoom` via pluv.io's [Yjs connection provider](https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/connection-provider) to enable collaboration on BlockNote.

## Installation

To setup BlockNote for collaborative editing with pluv.io, the following packages will need to be installed:

```bash
# Blocknote packages
npm install @blocknote/core @blocknote/mantine @blocknote/react

# pluv.io packages
npm install @pluv.io

# Peer dependencies
npm install yjs zod
```

## Enable Collaborative Editing

> **Note**: Most of this documentation mirrors [BlockNote's official documentation on collaborative editing](https://www.blocknotejs.org/docs/collaboration/real-time-collaboration). You can also follow the instructions there to get BlockNote connected with pluv.io.

To start, we will need at least a basic BlockNote editor:

```tsx
import { BlockNoteView } from "@blocknote/mantine";
import { useCreateBlockNote } from "@blocknote/react";
import type { FC } from "react";

export interface BlockNoteEditorProps {}

export const BlockNoteEditor: FC<BlockNoteEditorProps> = () => {
  const editor = useCreateBlockNote();

  return <BlockNoteView editor={editor} />;
};
```

Then we will need to setup:
1. Yjs storage on pluv.io with a [Yjs.XmlFragment](https://docs.yjs.dev/api/shared-types/y.xmlfragment) onto which BlockNote's editor contents will live.
2. Presence onto which BlockNote's presence and awareness state will live.

```ts
import { createClient } from "@pluv/client";
import { yjs } from "@pluv/crdt-yjs";
import type { InferBundleRoom } from "@pluv/react";
import { createBundle } from "@pluv/react";
import { z } from "zod";

const io = createClient({
  initialStorage: yjs.doc((t) => ({
    myEditor: t.xmlFragment("myEditor"),
  })),
  presense: z.object({
    // We'll put BlockNote's awareness data here.

    // We recommend having this be `any`, as this data is internal to
    // BlockNote and is complex

    // The field name can be whatever you choose
    myAwareness: z.any().default({}),
  }),
  // ... other pluv.io configs
});

const bundle = createBundle(io);

export const {
  // ... other utils
  useRoom,
  useStorage,
} = bundle;

export type PluvIORoom = InferBundleRoom<typeof bundle>;
```

Lastly, we will just need to define and forward BlockNote's Yjs connection provider to BlockNote's `useCreateBlockNote` hook to enable collaboration on BlockNote.

The `useCreateBlockNote` hook takes in a `Y.XmlFragment` as an input; however, this Yjs shared-type will be null while pluv.io is still connecting. So we will need to create a nested component that is able to accept the `Y.XmlFragment` as an input prop.

```tsx
import { BlockNoteView } from "@blocknote/mantine";
import { useCreateBlockNote } from "@blocknote/react";
import { yjs } from "@pluv/crdt-yjs";
import type { FC } from "react";
import { useMemo } from "react";
import type { XmlFragment as YXmlFragment } from "yjs";
import { useRoom, useStorage } from "./pluv";

const EXAMPLE_USER = { name: "john doe", color: "#6B5CFF" };

interface BlockNoteEditorInnerProps {
  fragment: YXmlFragment;
}

const BlockNoteEditorInner: FC<BlockNoteEditorInnerProps> = ({ fragment }) => {
  const room = useRoom();

  const provider = useMemo(() => {
    return yjs.provider({
      room,
      // This is the field we created on createClient's presence.
      // If this is not provided, all of the user awareness data will be
      // attempted to be stored on the presence root (and fail if not handled
      // in the presence schema).
      presenceField: "myAwareness",
    });
  }, [room]);

  const editor = useCreateBlockNote({
    collaboration: {
      provider,
      fragment,

      // This is used to show live text cursors
      user: {
        name: EXAMPLE_USER.name,
        color: EXAMPLE_USER.color,
      },
      // When to show user labels on the collaboration cursor. Set by default
      // to "activity" (show when the cursor moves), but can also be set to
      // "always"
      showCursorLabels: "activity",
    },
  });

  return <BlockNoteView editor={editor} />;
};

export interface BlockNoteEditorProps {}

export const BlockNoteEditor: FC<BlockNoteEditorProps> = () => {
  const [, fragment] = useStorage("myEditor");

  // While the fragment is still null (i.e. room is still connecting), we can
  // show a loading state in the meantime
  if (!fragment) return <div>Loading...</div>;

  return <BlockNoteEditorInner fragment={fragment} />;
};
```

That's all you need to enable realtime collaboration on BlockNote! From here on, you can further customize your BlockNote editor by following the official [BlockNote documentation](https://www.blocknotejs.org/docs). And you can persist the contents of your BlockNote editor by following pluv.io's documentation for [Loading Storage](/docs/io/loading-storage).
