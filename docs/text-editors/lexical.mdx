# Lexical

> **Note**: pluv.io integrates with Lexical only via Yjs (i.e. @pluv/crdt-yjs)

> **Note**: This documentation assumes that a basic pluv.io installation has already been completed. Please follow the [quickstart](/docs/quickstart/nextjs) to see how.

[Lexical](https://lexical.dev/) is an extensible rich text editor that emphasizes reliability, accessibility and performance. It also has been designed to support realtime collaboration with [Yjs](https://yjs.dev) via [@lexical/yjs](https://lexical.dev/docs/api/modules/lexical_yjs). Because pluv.io's storage API is built around Yjs, we can simply connect a Lexical editor to a `PluvRoom` via pluv.io's [Yjs connection provider](https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/connection-provider) to enable collaboration on Lexical.

## Installation

To setup Lexical for collaborative editing with pluv.io, the following packages will need to be installed:

```bash
# Lexical packages
npm install lexical @lexical/react @lexical/yjs

# pluv.io packages
npm install @pluv/crdt-yjs

# Peer dependencies
npm install yjs zod
```

## Enable Collaborative Editing

> **Note**: Most of this documentation mirrors [Lexical's official documentation on collaborative editing](https://lexical.dev/docs/collaboration/react). You can also follow the instructions there to get Lexical connected with pluv.io.

To start, we will need at least a basic Lexical editor:

```tsx
import type { FC } from "react";
import type { InitialConfigType } from "@lexical/react/LexicalComposer"
import { LexicalComposer } from "lexical/react/LexicalComposer";
import { ContentEditable } from "@lexical/react/LexicalContentEditable";
import { LexicalErrorBoundary } from "@lexical/react/LexicalErrorBoundary";
import { RichTextPlugin } from "@lexical/react/LexicalRichTextPlugin";

export interface LexicalEditorProps {}

const initialConfig: InitialConfigType = {
  namespace: "Demo",
  nodes: [],
  onError: (error: Error) => {
    throw error;
  },
  theme: {},
};

export const LexicalEditor: FC<LexicalEditorProps> = () => {
  return (
    <LexicalComposer initialConfig={initialConfig}>
      <RichTextPlugin
        contentEditable={<ContentEditable />}
        ErrorBoundary={LexicalErrorBoundary}
      />
    </LexicalComposer>
  );
};
```

Then we will need to setup:
1. Yjs storage on pluv.io with a [Yjs.XmlText](https://docs.yjs.dev/api/shared-types/y.xmltext) onto which Lexical's editor contents will live.
2. Presence onto which Lexical's presence and awareness state will live.

> **Note**: Lexical internally depends on a `Y.XmlText` called `root` that must exist as a top-level type on the Yjs document. In order for pluv.io to correctly connect with Lexical, this will need to be declared exactly as below until [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/facebook/lexical/issues/7537) has a resolution (meanwhile, we would appreciate an upvote on the GitHub issue to boost visibility).

```ts
import { createClient } from "@pluv/client";
import { yjs } from "@pluv/crdt-yjs";
import type { InferBundleRoom } from "@pluv/react";
import { createBundle } from "@pluv/react";
import { z } from "zod";

const io = createClient({
  initialStorage: yjs.doc((t) => ({
    // IMPORTANT!
    // Must be called "root" due to @lexical/yjs's internals!
    root: t.xmlText("root"),
  })),
  presense: z.object({
    // We'll put Lexical's awareness data here.

    // We recommend having this be `any`, as this data is internal to
    // Lexical and is complex

    // The field name can be whatever you choose
    myLexical: z.any().default({}),
  }),
  // ... other pluv.io configs
});

const bundle = createBundle(io);

export const {
  // ... other utils
  useRoom,
} = bundle;

export type PluvIORoom = InferBundleRoom<typeof bundle>;
```

Lastly, we will just need to define and forward pluv.io's Yjs connection provider to Lexical's `CollaborationPlugin` to enable collaboration on Lexical.

```tsx
import { CollaborationPlugin } from "@lexical/react/LexicalCollaborationPlugin";
import type { InitialConfigType } from "@lexical/react/LexicalComposer"
import { LexicalComposer } from "lexical/react/LexicalComposer";
import { ContentEditable } from "@lexical/react/LexicalContentEditable";
import { LexicalErrorBoundary } from "@lexical/react/LexicalErrorBoundary";
import { RichTextPlugin } from "@lexical/react/LexicalRichTextPlugin";
import { yjs } from "@pluv/crdt-yjs";
import type { FC } from "react";
import { useCallback } from "react";
import type { Doc as YDoc } from "yjs";
import { useRoom } from "./pluv";

export interface LexicalEditorProps {}

const EXAMPLE_USER = { name: "john doe", color: "#6B5CFF" };

const initialConfig: InitialConfigType = {
  // NOTE: This is critical for collaboration plugin to set editor state to
  // null. It would indicate that the editor should not try to set any default
  // state (not even empty one), and let collaboration plugin do it instead
  editorState: null,
  namespace: "Demo",
  nodes: [],
  onError: (error: Error) => {
    throw error;
  },
  theme: {},
};

export const LexicalEditor: FC<LexicalEditorProps> = () => {
  const room = useRoom();

  const providerFactory = useCallback(
    (id: string, yjsDocMap: Map<string, YDoc>) => {
      // We will let the `PluvRoom` provide the correct YDoc.
      // This condition should never be reached, so long as the room's id is
      // used as the id on the CollaborationPlugin below
      if (id !== room.id) throw new Error("Unexpected room id");

      const yDoc = room.getDoc().value;
      yjsDocMap.set(id, yDoc);

      return yjs.provider({
        room,
        // This is the field we created on createClient's presence.
        // If this is not provided, all of the user awareness data will be
        // attempted to be stored on the presence root (and fail if not handled
        // in the presence schema).
        presenceField: "myLexical",
      });
    },
    [room],
  );

  return (
    <LexicalComposer initialConfig={initialConfig}>
      <RichTextPlugin
        contentEditable={<ContentEditable />}
        ErrorBoundary={LexicalErrorBoundary}
      />
      <CollaborationPlugin
        // We recommend having this be the room's id
        id={room.id}
        providerFactory={providerFactory}

        // We recommend to disable bootstrap
        shouldBootstrap={false}

        // If you want to view live text cursors while editing
        username={EXAMPLE_USER.name}
        cursorColor={EXAMPLE_USER.color}
      />
    </LexicalComposer>
  );
};
```

That's all you need to enable realtime collaboration on Lexical! From here on, you can further customize your Lexical editor by following the official [Lexical documentation](https://lexical.dev/docs/intro). And you can persist the contents of your Lexical editor by following pluv.io's documentation for [Loading Storage](/docs/io/loading-storage).
