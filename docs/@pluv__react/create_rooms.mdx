# Create Rooms

Rooms are the channels that WebSockets can enter and leave (i.e. connect and disconnect). Events emitted by a connection in a room will be broadcasted only to connections within the same room.

## Create and connect to a PluvRoom

Create and connect to a `PluvRoom` by mounting a `PluvRoomProvider` from your `@pluv/react` bundle. When this provider is mounted, all of the hooks from the `createBundle` output will become usable in the child react tree, and the user joins the room as an active WebSocket connection. When the component unmounts, the user leaves the room.

> **Note**
> You may not have multiple PluvRoomProvider components mounted at the same time with the same `room` attribute within your app. Doing so may yield unexpected behaviors.

```tsx
import type { FC } from "react";
import { PluvRoomProvider } from "./frontend/io";

export const MyPage: FC = () => {
    return (
        <PluvRoomProvider
            // Optional: Set the value of `connect` to trigger a connect or
            // disconnect of the room.
            // Default: true
            connect={true}
            // Required if `presence` was set on the client: Define the user's
            // initial presence value
            initialPresence={{
                selectionId: null,
            }}
            // Optional: Overwrite the initialStorage value from the client
            initialStorage={(t) => ({
                messages: t.array("messages"),
            })}
            // Optional: Emits an error whenever authorization fails (when
            // `authorize` is set on the PluvIO instance`)
            onAuthorizationFail={(error: Error) => {
                console.error(error);
            }}
            // Required: The room's id
            room="my-room-id"
        >
            <MyRoom />
        </PluvRoomProvider>
    );
};
```
