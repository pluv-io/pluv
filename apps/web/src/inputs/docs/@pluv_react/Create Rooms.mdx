# Create Rooms

Rooms are the channels that WebSockets can enter and leave (i.e. connect and disconnect). Events emitted by sockets in a room will be broadcasted only to other sockets within the same room.

## Create and connect to a PluvRoom

Create and connect to a `PluvRoom` by mounting a `PluvRoomProvider` from your `@pluv/react` bundle. When this provider is mounted, all of the hooks from the `createRoomBundle` output will become usable in the child react tree, and the user joins the room as an active WebSocket connection. When the component unmounts, the user leaves the room.

> **Note**
> You may not have multiple PluvRoomProvider components mounted at the same time with the same `room` attribute within your app.

```tsx
import { FC } from "react";
import { PluvRoomProvider } from "frontend/io";

export const MyPage: FC = () => {
    return (
        <PluvRoomProvider room="my-room-id">
            <MyRoom />
        </PluvRoomProvider>
    );
};
```

export default ({ children }) => <DocsLayout meta={meta}>{children}</DocsLayout>;
