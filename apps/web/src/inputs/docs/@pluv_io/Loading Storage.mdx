# Loading Storage

Listen to when a room is deleted so that when the same room is re-created, users can resume from the same storage as where they left off.

## Add listeners

```ts
// server/io.ts

import { yjs } from "@pluv/crdt-yjs";
import { createIO } from "@pluv/io";
import { platformNode } from "@pluv/platform-node";
import { db } from "./db";

export const io = createIO({
    // Specify which CRDT to use here
    crdt: yjs,
    platform: platformNode(),
});

export const ioServer = io.server({
    // Load storage for a newly created room.
    getInitialStorage: async ({ room }) => {
        const existingRoom = await db.room.findUnique({ where: { room } });

        return existingRoom?.encodedState ?? null;
    },
    // Before the room is destroyed, persist the state to a database
    // to load when the room is re-created.
    onRoomDeleted: async ({ encodedState, room }) => {
        await db.room.upsert({
            where: { room },
            create: { encodedState, room },
            update: { encodedState },
        });
    },
    // It is unnecessary to save the storage state in this listener.
    // If a room already exists, users will load the currently active
    // storage before the storage from initialStorage.
    onStorageUpdated: ({ encodedState, room }) => {
        console.log(room, encodedState);
    },
});
```
