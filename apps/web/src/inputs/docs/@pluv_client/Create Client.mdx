# Create Client

Generally, it is recommended to use framework-specific bindings for your particular UI framework such as [@pluv/react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pluv/react). However, if your selected framework isn't yet supported, you can create a framework-agnostic pluv.io client to add automatic type-safe real-time to any app.

## Creating a PluvClient

> **Note**: These examples assume that you've already created a backend pluv.io
> instance. Refer to the [quickstart](/docs/quickstart) to learn more.

### Install dependencies

```bash
# For the frontend
npm install @pluv/client
```

### Define a frontend PluvClient

```ts
// frontend/io.ts

import { createClient } from "@pluv/client";
// Import the type from your PluvServer instance.
import { type AppPluvIO } from "server/io";

const client = createClient<AppPluvIO>({
    // Optional. Defaults to (room) => `/api/pluv/room/${room}`
    wsEndpoint: ({ room }): string => {
        // Specify the ws endpoint to connect to 
        return `http://localhost:3000/api/room?room=${room}`;
    },
});
```
